
Decellulator
============

A fun Arduino-powered fidget-game. The project originally started out as a processing sketch in Java. It was then converted to Rust in the hopes of generating libraries for both WASM/Javascript and Arduino C++ but I realized these goals were too lofty and refactored it once more using C++ so that I can generte a library I can use for Arduino development.

Last I left off I had written basically everything except for the game functions. basically I must pick up from ln ``340`` in ``pop_three.rs``
